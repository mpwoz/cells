//! Handle player input and translate it into movement through a character
//! controller. A character controller is the collection of systems that govern
//! the movement of characters.
//!
//! In our case, the character controller has the following logic:
//! - Set [`MovementController`] intent based on directional keyboard input.
//!   This is done in the `player` module, as it is specific to the player
//!   character.
//! - Apply movement based on [`MovementController`] intent and maximum speed.
//! - Wrap the character within the window.
//!
//! Note that the implementation used here is limited for demonstration
//! purposes. If you want to move the player in a smoother way,
//! consider using a [fixed timestep](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/movement/physics_in_fixed_timestep.rs).
